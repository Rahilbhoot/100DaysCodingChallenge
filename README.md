# 100 Days of Code: My Coding Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! 🚀 This repository is where I'll document my daily coding progress, challenges, and learnings over the next 100 days. My goal is to stay consistent, improve my coding skills, and build exciting projects along the way.

## Challenge Rules 🏆
- I will code for at least **1 hour** every day for **100 days**.
- I will document my progress in this README file daily.
- I will work on personal projects, open-source contributions, coding challenges, or learning new technologies.
- I will share my progress on social media using **#100DaysOfCode**.

## My Goals 🎯
- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Build real-world projects.
- Learn new technologies and frameworks.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Stay consistent and accountable.

## Daily Progress 📅

### Day 1: [03-03-2025]
- **What I did: I am watching Sigma Web Development course by CodeWithHarry on YouTube**
- **Challenges faced: I have alerady done JS but to keep myself revised and updated I have started this Js Series. So, in first day there was not much challenge but only fun.**
- **Learnings:**
  1. **Video 54 of playlist**
  -> I learned about starting concepts of javascript like methods to include JavaScript in our HTML file and got some idea about some properties of JavaScript like 'alert','prompt' & 'confirm'.I build an HTML file and then included this properties in it and tested them. Today I had started my JavaScript Revision Journey. So, it was fun.
  
  2. **Video 55 of playlist**
  -> In this video I learned about Variables in JavaScript. Got to know about var, let & const variables. I also learned about rules for choosing variables names and also studied about difference between 'let', 'var' & 'const' variables.Then I studied about Primitive dataTypes in JavaScript and also learned about objects in JavaScript. At last I performed a practice set of this video.
  
  3. **Video 56 of playlist**
  -> In this video I learned about expressions and conditionals in JavaScript. The main topics for today was If statements, If-else statements, I-else ladder which are conditional statements in JS. Secondly, I learned about operators in Javascript namely : 'Arithmatic operator', 'Assignment operator', 'Comparision operator' & 'Logical operator'. Today also learned about comments and types of comments in JS. The topic in the end was ternary operator in JavaScript which was intresting and challenging to understand.
